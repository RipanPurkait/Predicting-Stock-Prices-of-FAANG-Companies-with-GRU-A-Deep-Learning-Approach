### Predicting-Stock-Prices-of-FAANG-Companies-with-GRU-A-Deep-Learning-Approach
My project, "Predicting FAANG Stock Prices with GRU : A Deep Learning Approach," employs cutting-edge technology to forecast the stock prices of leading technology companies (FAANG) using data obtained from the Yahoo API. We harness the power of Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), a state-of-the-art neural network architecture, for building predictive models. By analyzing historical stock data, we aim to uncover patterns and trends, enabling accurate future price predictions. This project integrates data retrieval, preprocessing, and GRU model development, contributing to the realm of financial forecasting with a deep learning perspective.
